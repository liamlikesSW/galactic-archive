        <p>The Unknown Regions were a large region of the western 
        galaxy beyond the Outer Rim that was regarded as unexplored 
        and impassable due to a labyrinth of solar storms, rogue 
        magnetospheres, black holes, gravity wells, and things far 
        stranger; many exploration ships and probe droids were lost 
        trying to breach it. The homeworld of the Jedi Order, Ahch-To, 
        was located in the Unknown Regions, and dating as far back as 
        the Old Republic, the Jedi Order was known to utilize the 
        planet Ilum as a source of kyber crystals, which were 
        important in the construction of a Jedi's lightsaber. At a 
        young age, Jedi younglings were sent to Ilum to retrieve 
        these crystals, traveling into the Unknown Regions aboard 
        a ship known as the <em>Crucible</em>. The Chiss Ascendency, the 
        oligarchic government of the Chiss species </p>

        <p>located deep within the region sent the future 
        Grand Admiral Thrawn to forge an alliance with the Empire. 
        With Thrawn’s knowledge, the Emperor undertook the colonization 
        of the Unknown Regions, establishing a number of storehouses, 
        shipyards, and laboratories on distant moons and asteroids 
        beyond known space. Emerging after the fall of the Empire, 
        these colonies, with the aid of Imperial exiles, transformed 
        into the First Order, a militaristic hermit state. The First 
        Order amassed its numbers and power for years, far from the 
        eyes of the New Republic. They developed a terrifying mobile 
        weapon called Starkiller Base, which saw an entire planet 
        requisitioned into a dark energy converter that when fired 
        could be redirected to destroy entire systems.</p>

                    and canon content puts it somewhere in the middle. I decided
