                A tidally-locked planet, it had one moon called Cynda, which was rich in thorilide crystals. Gravitational forces of its star and its moon, Cynda, caused one side of the planet to permanently face its sun while the opposite side of the planet was stuck in perpetual darkness. As a result, the hemisphere of Gorse that baked in constant daylight experienced temperatures hot enough to melt droids. Only the humid night side of the planet was habitable. The planet suffered from constant groundquakes due to its strange gravitational state. Cities covered much of the dark side of Gorse. There, thorilide crystals imported from Cynda were refined and processed for use in shielding starships from turbolaser cannons.</p>

                <p>Many of those working in this industry were housed at Crispus Commons, an apartment building for veterans of the Clone Wars. Gorse had several urban settlements including Gorse City, Shaketown, and Highground. During the Age of the Empire, Gorse had seemingly exhausted its thorilide reserves and had become a major refinery for thorilide exports from Cynda, which had been opened up to thorilide mining. Gorse served as the location of a conflict between the Galactic Empire and a small rebel cell led by Hera Syndulla and the former Jedi Padawan Kanan Jarrus. Following the Gorse conflict, thorilide mining was established in Gorse's sunward side while Cynda was restored to its former status as a nature reserve.<br>

The warm climate led to lush green hills in summertime, vineyards with the potential to produce top-class wines, and tall, slender conifers that waved slightly in the breeze. Giant cliffs judded out into the water, their white stone imposing itself on the seascape. The planet had a small population, and the entire royal complex, including the palace, were in and around those same cliffs. They had been hollowed out with windows in various geometric shapes hewn from the rock. The only hints above the surface was the round temple known as the Celestial Chalice, and grounds so thickly forested with trees that it was easy to miss the manicured lawns </p>

Pijal had ancient planetary shield generators in orbit, but they weren’t strong enough to block most ships. Millennia ago, according to local legend, Pijal had been one of the first worlds to adopt planetary shield technology. At some point, the local form of Force worship began urging pilgrims to travel into space periodically to experience the darkness and zero-gravity for themselves—so as to make them truly grateful for the beautiful planet they had. The vessels they use for these trips are called soulcraft. They are ancient ships, but they are valued because of their ancientness. Circles and spheres tend to be sacred shapes on Pijal.
